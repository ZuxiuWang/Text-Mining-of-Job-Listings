Data Team Lead
About the job
Moneysmart is hiring a Data Team lead to help lead our team of young, eager data engineers and analysts. Together you and your team will work to build a stable and scalable data infrastructure that will be able to help the business to collect, process and store masses of raw information securely, accurately and efficiently. With all that information on hand, we’ll be looking to you to help us design and build amazing data products to improve user experiences on our Moneysmart sites as well as build up the business intelligence capabilities within our organization.
We’re looking for someone who is experienced and has done similar work like this elsewhere before. You will be working closely with people from other departments like Product, Marketing and Strategy to help understand their needs and design solutions that will enable them to deliver on their goals. Examples of this could be:
Onboarding customer data from external systems so further analysis can be conducted on it and we can discover/better understand customer preferences and trends
Building a recommendation engine that can recommend products based on user’s past choices, creating a more personalized and desirable experience
Creating a near real time reporting platform so that the country managers can get information in a more timely manner to make decisions quickly
To be able to do all these, you’ll need to plan and manage the Data Team’s roadmap well and help prioritize the work that needs to be done so that we can see the awesome impact it could bring sooner rather than later.
You will be expected to be technical as well. Being able to build data pipelines, write code and tune database queries will be a requirement since you’ll need to review and vet the work your team has done. The engineers will be looking to you to learn about best practices in building pipelines and running analysis, industry standards on data infrastructure and what clean, maintainable code looks like. The team currently writes most of their code in Python and SQL at the moment (we use R sometimes as well). But fluency in any other Big Data framework language will be highly welcome.
Our data engineers and analysts are a smart and talented bunch but they will require leadership and direction from their lead (which is you), someone who has been through the many phases of what it takes to build and maintain a production level data infrastructure, has seen the pitfalls and can help show them the way. Besides providing technical expertise to the team, a core part of this role will be to help mentor and develop the members of your team (as well as other developers in our department) professionally, and work towards creating a conducive environment for developers to thrive, making Moneysmart an ideal place to work and grow your career.
If you’re ready to take up the important mantle of become a Data Team Lead in Moneysmart’s Technology department, send us your resume now! We would really love to hear from you.

Who we are
----------

Open Government Products is an in-house team of engineers, designers, and product managers who build technology for the public good. We proactively identify areas where technology can help, test our prototypes with actual users, and bring our best ones to launch. This includes everything from building better frontend applications for citizens, to automating the internal operations of public agencies. We use and release open source software, keep a flat hierarchy, and bypass bureaucracy to focus on delivery. We work on real problems, build for the user, and push for change.

Projects we have worked on include:
Data.gov.sg - An open repository of all the Singapore Government's public data. It helps people understand the data using visualizations and articles, and provides real-time APIs for developers to use.

Beeline - A data-driven shuttle bus platform. Bus routes are created from user suggestions and public transport usage data. Users can book, pay for, and track rides using a mobile app.

Parking.sg - A mobile app alternative to parking coupons. It lets users pay, extend, and refund their parking sessions just using their phones.

Form.sg - A form builder tool for agencies to self-service and create online forms that capture classified data, with the goal of replacing paper forms.

---------------------------------
What does a Software Engineer do?
---------------------------------

As a software engineer, you will:
Build prototypes to demonstrate technological opportunities
Design system architectures
Write production quality code
Manage deployments to cloud infrastructure
Because our team focuses on pushing new initiatives, you will also have to:

Identify potential projects that improve the public good
Design novel systems that work around bureaucratic constraints
Advocate and explain these technical ideas to other government agencies
Additionally, more senior engineers will be expected to:
Establish best practices for developer operations
Share your expertise and mentor other engineers
Help with recruiting
You're not just here to write code, but also to figure out what we should be building and how we should build it.

Your job will be to bring expertise and capability to the public sector. Sometimes this means coding new systems from scratch. Other times this means using the best solutions the development community has to offer. We use cloud services, open source software, and commodity hardware as far as possible. These often include, but are not limited to: GitHub, AWS, React Native, MongoDB, and Stripe amongst others. Knowing what to build and what to reuse lets us avoid wasting time on solved problems and focus on delivering actual value.

You will work on meaningful projects that solve problems pertinent to our society, from transportation, to education, to healthcare. The public sector is full of opportunities where even the simplest software can have a big impact on people’s lives. You will have direct ownership of your work with over 70% of our projects starting as ground up initiatives. Rather than work on commercial ventures commonly found in the startup scene, we're here to improve how we live as a society through what we can offer as a government.

----------------------------
What it is like working here
----------------------------

Rapid Prototyping - Instead of spending too much time debating ideas we prefer testing them. This identifies potential problems quickly, and more importantly, conveys what is possible to others easily.

Ownership - In addition to technical responsibilities, this means having opinions on what is being done and having ideas on what should be done next. Building something that you believe in is the best way to build something good.

Continuous Learning - Working on new ideas often means not fully understanding what you are working on. Taking time to learn new architectures, frameworks, technologies, and even languages is not just encouraged but essential.

------

------

----------------------
Who we are looking for
----------------------

We work mostly in Javascript with some Python on the backend. However, we don’t require experience in any specific programming language or technology. Core competency in at least one language and the ability to learn is what matters to us.

We look for people who:
Have a demonstrated ability to build software - Prior work and personal projects count for much more than specific degrees.

Write code to solve abstract programming problems - Clear thinking, the ability to debug, and understanding the limits of an approach matter much more than getting the “correct” answer.

Talk and reason about code with other engineers - We work as a team so you need to be able to not just solve problems, but have other people understand your solutions.

Take initiative to make things happen - Our job is to push for change in government, so we need to challenge the status quo and not wait for instruction.

Want to work for the public good - We are public servants, we serve the public. This sometimes means ignoring political pressures and misguided policies. We need people who will push back if something is not in the public interest.

Overall we look for people who have ability, initiative, good communication, and strong values.

We regret that as a Singapore Government Agency, only Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will be considered."

In this role, you will support our Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO). Based out of our Singapore location, you will be a key part of the team providing a broad range of support and enablement.

What this job involves:

Controlling the Schedule
Have you supported C-suite individuals in managing their schedules, travel plans, and meetings? With responsibility for the itinerary and calendar, you will be the go-to person when stakeholders need access to the Executives. You will need to have an iron grip on the diaries of the CFO and CHRO to ensure the Executives aren’t overwhelmed. The Executives’ travel plans will be your responsibility too. Transport will need to be organised, visas achieved, accommodation booked and client entertainment accounted for – all within budget and time lines.

Meetings and their Management
Meetings, workshops, events – how much can you handle? Unsurprisingly, our leaders have a lot of them! You will need to understand how to prioritize these events; setting expectations to ensure deadlines and deliverables are met. In addition, you will need to make sure the meetings, workshops and events are well prepared and conducted. “Is the right technology and materials available? Is there a set agenda? Who will take the minutes?” – It’s these types of questions that you will need to be able to answer.

Hosting our Guests
How well do you host? Overseas visitors regularly come to meet with our Finance and HR Executives. Instinctively, you will understand the importance of a positive guest experience in maintaining strong business relationships. Embracing this ethos, you will ensure all of their needs are catered for, including securing meeting rooms, hotels, transfers, and so on.

Administrative Support
How well do you work in a team? In this role, you will work closely with other Executive Assistants to ensure a number of administrative tasks are completed. Included in this are the coordination of signatories to legal documents, sourcing office supplies and ensuring the office environment is maintained in line with our policies & procedures. Specifically you will provide support to our Executive Assistant to the CEO and COO from time to time and also provide direct support to these Executives during any absence. In addition, you’ll help with the on-boarding of new team members within Finance & HR.

Sound like you? To apply, you need to be:

Knowledgeable and experienced
You should have a relevant Diploma and experience of working with a department head in a large international organisation. IT skilled and any experience or certification in other presentation related software applications or systems would go a long way.

Independent
Your proactive nature means you will need little management oversight. You are also able to adapt to a multi-cultural and team-oriented environment.

A positive thinker and strong communicator
Are you a confident, energetic and customer-oriented? Can you interact with stakeholders across all levels? A great match for this job would be someone who has a well-presented, approachable manner as well as superb written and spoken English communication skills.

Capable
You have the ability to work under pressure, multi-task and meet tight deadlines in a fast-paced environment. You are meticulous with an ‘eye’ for detail, positive and solution orientated. You are somebody who is calm and we can trust to handle confidential and sensitive information with discretion. Clear written and verbal communication skills across a variety of mediums is a must.

Flexible
Having worked with other senior leadership, you will understand the necessity of managing workloads outside of normal office hours. Accessibility is key to these individuals and you will be ready to provide professional support at all times.

What we can do for you:

At JLL, we make sure that you become the best version of yourself by helping you realize your full potential in an entrepreneurial and inclusive work environment. We will empower your ambitions through our dedicated Total Rewards Program, competitive pay and benefits package.

Food waste is a $1 trillion problem – costing the world over 1% of global GDP. We’re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.
Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 25 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore and Iowa City. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.
Winnow’s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% over 2 - 12 months, and maintained at these levels, with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers, and a net saving of staff time due to reduced food preparation and waste handling. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for restaurants. Watch our short videos on our YouTube channel to see the system in action.
We are passionate about living our values and place them at the centre of everything we do. We are excited about likeminded talent who share these values, joining us in our mission:
Equal parts head and heart. We’re both passionate and measured. We carefully balance the need for quick solutions and pragmatism with the ability to step back, take in the bigger picture and build for the long term.
Bravely honest. With each other, that means we’re a transparent organisation where healthy, respectful debate is encouraged. With our customers, we challenge them if we don’t think they’re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.
People of action. Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We’re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.
Bound by food. We’re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.
Hungry and humble. Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we’re hungry for change. But, we’re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.
This is an opportunity to join a rapidly growing start-up (and one of Wired’s top 100 start-ups in Europe) and help us propel our growth at what is truly the most exciting and dynamic points in time in our business. You will work alongside a driven team who are motivated by building an exciting business and leaving the world a better place than we found it.

(Job Number: 01V0Q)
We are looking for the Brian Eno of Technology, someone who loves using generative systems to hack the future, through code, visuals, haptics, audio, ...
You’re equal parts dreamer and pragmatist, and can freely traverse the world of ideas and the world of implementation. You’re a creative problem solver with skills in rapid prototyping, code based animation and physical computing.
We think you might have worked as a developer, IoT engineer, interactive designer, and wondering “what’s next?”. You have been experimenting with physical x digital experiences for 6-8 years and you’re curious about the opportunity to play a leading role on a multi-disciplinary design team driving innovation in the Singapore government.
The team you will be joining:
The Experience Strategy & Design (ESD) team was formed to help drive an ‘outside-in’ approach to the development of the next generation of government services. Made up of researchers, experience strategists, interaction designers, service and environment specialists, visual and content designers, the team leads user research, product conceptualization and prototyping on key strategic initiatives for the Government Digital Services (GDS) group. Our model is to bring together domain & policy experts, data scientists, designers, product managers and engineers, to define the right problems to solve, identify opportunities to make an impact, and to experiment with bold and disruptive ideas.
What to expect:
At ESD we believe that Design Technologists make their greatest impact when they work at the
intersection of caring about what people need, uncovering what technology can do and making
simple, engaging experiences. And do so with an experimental mindset, continuously prototyping,
testing and learning about why something is working or not.

We’re looking for people who want to get their hands dirty throughout the entire design process. To be involved in everything from going in the field to build empathy for user needs first-hand, to bringing insights to life through compelling stories and visual experiences, as well as creating interactive experiences and user interfaces of all kinds.

We work in an extremely collaborative environment, alongside other teams of designers, developers, data scientists, domain experts and policy folks with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. It’s important that you are always engaging the outside world for inspiration, spotting opportunities for innovation and sharing what excites you with the broader community.
How to succeed:

You are purpose driven. You care deeply about what design, technology and data could do to improve people’s lives.
You are MacGyver. You can quickly identify whatever resources there are around you to hack together a physical x digital experience prototype.

You are an advocate for exceptional design. You know the difference between ‘good’ and ‘great’ and are able to work within challenging problem spaces and stakeholder dynamics. Not only can you identify and implement best practices, but you’re able to push boundaries and explore new territory.

You are a product owner. You want the responsibility to work end-to-end, from upfront research, conceptualising, prototyping, launching and continually evolving digital products.

You are energized by working in teams. It’s totally ok to go heads-down when it comes time to crafting the details, but you also believe that the best solutions are the product of creative collaboration.

You have excellent discretion, demonstrating sound judgment in dealing with confidential dialogues and information.


Relevant experience:

Bachelor’s and/or Master’s degree in Computational Design, Computer Science/Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, HCI, interaction design, or a related discipline.

6-8 years of experience designing and developing digital products, culminating in the ability to execute or lead a project from visioning to writing production-ready code.


Skills we are looking for:

Computational design whiz. You’re an expert in Processing.js, D3.js, WebGL, or other interactive and data visualisation frameworks

Rapid prototyping to technical execution. You’re an expert in physical x digital prototyping, embedded systems and physical computing

Fundamentals of programming. You have experience in either Web (HTML/CSS/JS) or Mobile Application (iOS/Android/React Native) development.

Storytelling skills: you are able to compellingly communicate the story of design solutions to different audiences with different needs, agendas and levels of understanding.

Co-creation. You are a natural at enabling non-designers to engage in design discussions and participate in ideating solutions. And using your ‘toolbox of skills & activities’ to enable others make their strategies and ideas more visual and tangible.


Special powers:
We'd ideally like you to have some of what is listed below. We are not expecting you to be able to do it all. Just let us know which ones you’re really good at.

Inclusive design: experience designing for people of all abilities

Illustration: the ability to sketch and quickly visualise ideas or storyboard user journeys
